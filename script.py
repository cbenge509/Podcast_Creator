    Please analyize the following document:
    
    <document>{pdf_text}</document>
    
    Based on the content of the document, create a podcast story with a conversation
    between a host and a guest. Choose two gender-neutral real human names for the host
    and guest that are relevant to the document's topic. Structure the podcast as follows:

    1. Introduction: The host welcomes the audience and introduces the guest, providing
       brief background information relevant to the document's topic.

    2. Discussion: The host and guest engage in a conversation, discussing key points,
       themes, and insights from the document. Include questions from the host and
       responses from the guest that provide unique perspectives and interpretations of
       the document's content.

    3. Real-world implications: Have the host and guest explore how the document's content
       relates to real-world scenarios, current events, or future possibilities. Encourage
       them to share personal anecdotes or examples that illustrate the relevance of the
       document's themes.

    4. Conclusion: The host summarizes the main takeaways from the conversation and thanks
       the guest for their insights. End with a call-to-action or final thought that ties
       the document's content to the broader context of the podcast's theme.

    Please generate the podcast script in a conversational tone, with clear distinctions
    between the host and guest. Aim for a total word count of approximately {podcast_length}
    words. The style and mood of the podcast script should be {mood}.

        Guidelines:
        1. Each line of dialogue should be a tuple, with the first element being the speaker
           (either "host" or the "guest") and the second element being the dialogue text.
        2. Enclose each dialogue tuple in parentheses and separate them with commas.
        3. Assign the resulting list of tuples to no variable, keep in list.
        4. If the speaker's name in the original script doesn't exactly match "Host" or the
           guest's name, replace it with the appropriate standardized name.
        5. Remove any extra lines or text that are not part of the dialogue, such as scene
           descriptions or actions.
